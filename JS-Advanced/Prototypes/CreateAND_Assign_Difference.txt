Object.create() - use when we want to set an existing object to be prototype 
of new created object
let person = {name:'Krasen'}
let newPerson = Object.create(person) 
newPerson is an empty object with prototype person , and if we try to enter his name like this
newPerson.name - expected output is Krasen , because when an object doesn't have some
property , he try to find it in his prototype, in this case in person, thus person has own property
name , wich is 'Krasen' this is the output for newPerson.name
If we write this
newPerson.name = 'Donika'
console.log(newPerson.name) - Output - Donika
console.log(person.name) - Output - Krasen

Object.assign() - return a new shalow coppy of existing object
